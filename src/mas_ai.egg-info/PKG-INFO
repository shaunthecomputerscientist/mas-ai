Develop 2 architecture for agent:
1. Router,Reflector,Evaluator âœ…
2. Planner, Executor, Reflector (not yet)
    - plan the tasks
    - execute the tasks from lists, map them to task ids.
    - Reflector will reflect on the results of the tasks and the plan.
    - rePlan else exit

Key types of memory:

1. Agent Memory:
    - Short term memory: From chat history, context, input
    - Component Short Term Memory: Each component within an agent has its own short term memory.
    -Component Shared Memory: Each component has it's shared memory to communicate with other components within the system.
    -Component Long Short Term Memory: Each component has it's own long short term memory to keep track of the past interactions. These are collective summaries of n past interactions. Where n is the long context order.

2. Multi Agent System Memory:
    - Shared Memory: A Shared Memory Across all agents. Decided by memory-order key in sequential mas and decentralized mas. Default to 3.
    This shared memory is typically short term, unless it's used to create summary and store in Long Short Term Memory.

Short Term Memory in all agents is enabled by default. It must not be turned off. Only memory_order can be manipulated.
